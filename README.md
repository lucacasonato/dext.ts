- Client hydration
- Built-in routing
- Zero config TypeScript support

## Installing

To install, run the following command. This will make the `dext` CLI available in your path.

```
deno install --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run --unstable -f -n dext https://deno.land/x/dext@0.5.0/cli.ts
```

For an example, see the `/example` folder. You can create a production build it by running
`dext build`, and then serve it by running `dext start`. You can also run `dext dev` to
start watching, building, and serving.

You can also see a deployed version of this example on at https://dext.fly.dev.
